        <p> BigRuby have partnered with <a href="http://rubycentral.org/community">Ruby Central</a> to offer a limited number of full conference registration scholarships for BigRuby conference on 2014 Feb. 20 & 21, which is open to anyone who would not normally attend, though we specifically encourage students, women, minorities, and other under-represented groups in the technology sector to apply. The Opportunity Scholarship is a chance to jump in to learn more about Ruby specifically and software development in general. Note: the scholarship does not include any travel or hotel assistance.
        </p>
        <p>Scholars will be partnered with Guides: experienced programmers who have attended BigRuby before and are already familiar with many of the key players at the conference. Guides will act as ambassadors for the duration of the conference, allowing Scholars to meet established developers, learn more about software development, and begin connecting to the Ruby community. If you or someone you know is interested in applying, please read the application instructions below.
        </p>

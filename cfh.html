        <h3>What is a "Hacker in Residence"?</h3>

        <p>Speaking at a conference isn't for everyone and at Big Ruby we wanted to create a way for great programmers who don't like the stage to share their knowledge with our attendees. We are looking for 8 individuals to be available throughout the conference for pair programming and one-on-one teaching.</p>

        <h3>That sounds really abstract. Got anything more concrete?</h3>

        <p>At the conference, we will be setting up a Hacking Hub with 4 fully stocked pairing stations. (Big monitor, keyboard/mouse, snacks, etc.) </p>

        <p>As a Hacker in Residence, you will be available at the Hub for six scheduled 35 minute sessions throughout the conference. (We'll work on the exact schedule once the lineup is set, but times will mirror the speaking schedule.)</p>

        <p>Attendees will sign up for a one-on-one session with you during one of your scheduled times.</p>

        <h3>What will I be sharing in my session?</h3>

        <p>We are picking 8 Hackers on purpose, two for each of our themes: 
        <ul>
            <li>Infrastructure as Code</li>
            <li>Need for Speed (Performance)</li>
            <li>Service Oriented Architectures</li>
            <li>Go Big or Go Home (Big Data)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>We are asking that you bring a project to both walk through and work on with your pair during the 35 minutes. Ideally, this project would have several components that relate to the topic.</p>

        <p>This project can be something you've already built, something open source, or something else.</p>

        <h3>What's in it for me?</h3>

        <p>All benefits of being a speaker will be extended to you. You will be featured on the website and receive free admission to the conference. You will also be given a few minutes on stage to introduce yourself and your topic to the audience at the opening of Big Ruby.</p>

        <p>On top of all of this you'll be in a position to directly help fellow programmers while participating in a program that we believe is very unique.</p>

        <h3>I still don't know about this...</h3>

        <p>Neither do we! But we believe this effort of giving members of our community a unique way to share their skills and knowledge is one worth pursuing and hope you'd like to join us in that. We are open to your suggestions and/or concerns.</p>

        <h3>Ok. Sound good. What next?</h3>

        <p>Our Call for Hackers is now open and will be until December 30 23:59:59 CST. Complete the application and we'll be in touch shortly after the close of the deadline.</p>

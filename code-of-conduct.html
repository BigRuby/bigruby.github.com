      <h1 class="head">Big Ruby<br/>Code of conduct</h1>

      <div class="container">
        <p>Big Ruby believes our community should be open for everyone. We are
        committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for
        all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
        religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text
        editor.</p>

        <p>We expect all conference participants to help us realize a safe and
        positive conference experience for everyone. At all conference venues
        and conference-affiliated social events we expect everyone will:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
        <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
        conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in
        distress.</li>
        <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to
        create Big Ruby and make it your own.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unacceptable behaviors include harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or
        derogatory conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments related to
        gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate
        use of sexual images (including in presentations); deliberate
        intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or
        recording; sustained disruption of talks or events; inappropriate
        physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p>These behaviors will not be tolerated and anyone asked to stop is
        expected to comply immediately. If a participant behaves unacceptably,
        the conference organizers may take action they deem appropriate,
        including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.</p>

        <p>The Big Ruby team is available to help participants contact venue security
        or local law enforcement and to otherwise ensure everyone feels safe for
        the duration of the conference. If you or anyone else are subject to
        unacceptable behavior, or you have any other concerns, notify an
        organizer as soon as possible. You can reach us at:
